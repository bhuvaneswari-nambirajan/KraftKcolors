    Welcome to my Art page. this page you can witness all of my paintings starting from my first artwork to my present work.Let's get you to know me.
    My name is Bhuvaneswari. My interest in art started off during my early school days. At school we have a seperate ART class with other academic classes.
    I participated in many art competitons but never won. But that didn't stop me from drawing.
    Later my Art classes became more interesting as we passed classes. I still remember my art teacher Mrs.Emilda whom I used to admire.
    She just makes art so easy with the way she moves her pencil to draw something. She is my Inspiration till date.
